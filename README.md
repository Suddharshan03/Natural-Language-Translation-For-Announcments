# Natural-Language-Translation-For-Announcments
The domain of our project revolves around the translation of different types of announcements, addressing the need for effective communication across globally diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. In various settings such as transportation hubs, airports, and public spaces, announcements play a crucial role in disseminating information. People who are visually challenged or have hearing impairments may encounter challenges in comprehending announcements made in various locations. The goal is to create a solution that can seamlessly interpret and convey announcements in multiple languages, ensuring that important messages are accessible to a broader audience.


The project aims for the Natural Language Translation System to provide accurate and contextually relevant translations for announcements, ensuring that information is effectively conveyed to speakers of different languages. The system comprises modules, namely M1 for text translation, M2 for text to audio translation, and M3 for image to text translation.


In our project, we carefully selected a development environment where a diverse array of programming languages, tools, and frameworks harmoniously interact with each other to implement the functionalities mentioned above. Javascript, serving as the cornerstone and the development was facilitated by the utilization of an industry-standard Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) named Visual Studio Code, enhancing code writing, debugging, and organization. The frontend components of our project were constructed using fundamental web technologies: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. In addition to the mentioned technologies, our project incorporated robust database connectivity using MySQL, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of data. Furthermore, our project leveraged external APIs, specifically translation APIs such as the Google Cloud Translation API, to facilitate accurate and seamless translation of text content.
